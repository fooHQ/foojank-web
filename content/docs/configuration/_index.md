Foojank adopts a server-client architecture, with its configuration heavily shaped by the authentication and authorization principles of a NATS server.
To simplify the process, Foojank provides commands for generating configurations with sensible defaults, reducing much of the complexity.
However, familiarity with basic NATS concepts - such as operators, accounts, and users - is still recommended.
These topics are beyond the scope of this documentation, so please consult the official NATS documentation for details.
Additionally, NATS offers an excellent introduction to [JWT-based authentication and authorization](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/securing_nats/auth_intro/jwt).

The server supports WebSocket connections secured with TLS. Currently, it uses only a self-signed certificate, which is automatically generated by the configuration command.

Foojank uses [TOML](https://toml.io) as its configuration format.
